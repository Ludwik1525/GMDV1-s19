# Game Development - Project #1 - aMAZEd
First project for Game Development course. <br/>
The game is a really basic FPS maze shooter where the goal is to escape from a labyrinth while avoiding enemies and unlocking the way out with
several triggers. <br/>
Everything is done in Unity and uses C# for scripting.
